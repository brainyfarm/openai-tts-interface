# OpenAI Speech Synthesizer Interface

This project provides a user-friendly web interface for OpenAI's speech synthesis API, allowing users to easily convert text into speech using various models, voices, and output formats. Designed to be accessible to non-technical users while also offering customization options for developers, this interface acts as a wrapper around OpenAI's API, simplifying the process of generating speech from text.

## For Non-technical Users

### Getting Started

No installation is required. Access the application through your web browser with:

- A modern web browser.
- An API token from OpenAI for authentication.

### How to Use

1. **Enter API Token:** Input your OpenAI API Token.
2. **Model and Voice Selection:** Select from a variety of speech models and voices.
3. **Output Format:** Choose your preferred audio output format.
4. **Input Text:** Type the text you want to convert into speech.
5. **Generate Speech:** Press "Generate" to create speech from your text.

### Tips

- Protect your API token to prevent unauthorized access.
- Experiment with different models and voices to find the best fit for your needs.

## For Developers

This interface is designed to simplify interactions with OpenAI's speech synthesis API. Developers can extend or customize the interface according to their requirements.

### Configuration and Customization

- **API Endpoint:** The interface is pre-configured to use OpenAI's speech synthesis API. Changes to the API endpoint can be made in the `script.js`.
- **Adding Models and Voices:** Modify the arrays in `script.js` to add or remove model and voice options.
- **Output Formats:** Adjust the array for output formats to cater to different audio preferences.

### TODO and Enhancements

- **User Authentication:** Implement a secure way for users to manage their API tokens.
- **Localization and Internationalization:** Make the interface available in multiple languages to reach a wider audience.
- **Accessibility Features:** Ensure the web interface is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities.
- **Audio Processing Options:** Introduce features for audio manipulation and customization post-synthesis.

### Contributions

Contributions are welcome in the form of code improvements, feature additions, bug fixes, and documentation updates. To contribute:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Make a copy of the project to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Feature Branch:** Work on your contributions in a separate branch.
3. **Submit a Pull Request:** Once your work is complete, submit it for review.

### Getting Involved

This project is open for contributions from developers, UI/UX designers, and documentation experts. Join us in enhancing this interface to make speech synthesis more accessible and user-friendly.
